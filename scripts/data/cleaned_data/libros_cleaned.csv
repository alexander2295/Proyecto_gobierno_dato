Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",PUBLISH,"christian bauer, gavin king",java

Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.",PUBLISH,dan allen,java

GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.",PUBLISH,"robert hanson, adam tacy","internet, java"

What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.",PUBLISH,erik keller,business

TDD and its supporting tools and techniques lead to better software faster.    Test Driven brings under one cover practical TDD techniques distilled from several years of community experience. With examples in Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both the techniques and the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully chosen examples to illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in the abstract but concretely in the context of the technologies you face at work.

It offers a practical approach to design: how to become a better programmer by studying problems and solutions to the most important problems surrounding the technology.    The flip side of design patterns, antipatterns, are a fun and interesting way to take EJB expertise to the next level. The book covers many different aspects of EJB, from transactions to persistence to messaging, as well as performance and testing.    Bitter EJB will teach programmers to do the following:    Identify EJB persistence strategies  Choose Entity bean alternatives  Use EJB message driven beans  Know when to apply or avoid stateful session beans  Create efficient build strategies with XDoclet, Ant and JUnit  Automate performance tuning",PUBLISH,"bruce tate, mike clark, bob lee, patrick linskey","java, internet"
